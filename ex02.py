# This piece of code asks for the user to input 2 numbers via command line
# It'll sum them up and print the result
# You may run it a couple times to identify what is going wrong with the output
# And then change how to process the user's input so that the result will be correct

b = input("Inser the second number: ")
sum = a + b

print(f"The sum of {a} and {b} is {sum}")
